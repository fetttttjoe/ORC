# M5b — Grounded-Plan Strategy (design)

**Date:** 2026-07-19
**Status:** Design — brainstormed with the user; awaiting spec review, then writing-plans.
**Relates to:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-19-m5a-recursion-core-design.md` (the recursion core
this rides on — `strategyRef`, the SignalRouter route registry, the DBOS-port two-way loop, the
durable gate, and the `task_split` tree all reserved/available for exactly this);
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-19-m4c-memory-graph-recursive-mas-design.md` (the typed-link
knowledge graph the plan itself is built in); `docs/superpowers/research/codebase-memory-mcp.md` and
`.../code-review-graph.md` (structural-graph prior art we learn from and defer).

## 0. Thesis (one paragraph)

A task becomes a **grounded plan the human shapes conversationally, then starts** — and the plan is
itself a **bounded, task-scoped graph of linked plan-notes**, not a monolithic document. The runtime
(not the agent's own reasoning, not a human hand-feeding every round) orchestrates the phases
durably: optionally **analyze the codebase** (seeding the M4c knowledge graph we want built anyway),
**plan** into a masterplan-note that `decomposes_into` subplan-notes — each a bounded unit with its
own requirements, rationale, and explicit uncertainties — let the human **annotate and iterate with
the plan-agent** per note until it matches their intent, then on **approve ("start")** hand the
frozen plan-graph to M5a execution, where `decomposes_into` children become `task_split` children.
This is the first, deliberately minimal, coordination strategy of M5b — one real consumer for the
reserved `strategyRef`/router seam. The general `CoordinationStrategy` registry, the other
RecursiveMAS topologies, slots/presets, the UI, the scoped-rules system, and the structural AST
indexer are all **deferred behind named seams**.

## 1. Scope

**In (M5b, this spec):**
- The `grounded-plan` **strategy** — runtime-orchestrated phases on the DBOS port.
- The **`Analyzer` seam** + the lazy `agent-analyzer` (agent + `codebase-analysis` skill) + a
  `CoverageReport` contract.
- A **conversational gate primitive** (durable question → free-text answer), reused by consent,
  annotation-driven re-plan, and mid-run feedback.
- The **plan as a task-scoped graph of plan-notes** — a `kind:'plan'` M4c note category, a new
  `decomposes_into` link kind, `rationale`/`uncertainty[]` on the plan-note.
- **Annotation events** + a **scoped re-plan** loop + **plan versioning**.
- A **vault-projector render delta** (per-plan-note markdown with links to subplan files + a
  mermaid decomposition/dependency DAG).
- A **per-role memory tier** (scout/verify/auditor) on the strategy config.

**Out (deferred — seam named so nothing re-adds it):**
- The **UI** (visual plan editor, the literal "start" button). Foundations are events; the UI is
  later pure rendering + event emission. Seam: the annotation/message event shapes (D5).
- The **general scoped-rules system** (global/project/task rules tied to skills). Seam: M5a
  `ApprovalPolicy` + per-project `vault/skills` + per-step `skillRefs`, reused as-is.
- **Other topologies** (Mixture/Distillation/Deliberation), **slots + presets**, and any general
  `CoordinationStrategy` **registry**. Seam: `strategyRef` + the router route registry (D9).
- The **structural AST indexer** (`ast-analyzer`) and analytics on it (hot paths, high churn,
  diff-seeded blast radius). Seam: the `Analyzer` plugin type (D2) + cbm's taxonomy banked in §8.
- **Targeted-patch re-plan.** Seam: the re-plan `scope` parameter (D6) — full-scope shipped, subset
  a later value, no rewrite.

## 2. Requirements

- **RG1 Runtime-orchestrated.** The phases are durable workflow steps; every phase boundary is an
  event, so the whole strategy is replayable, crash-safe, and auditable (log-is-truth). Not a prompt
  pattern in the agent's head.
- **RG2 Consent-gated analysis.** Before reading the repo the strategy asks (conversationally) and
  proceeds only on the human's yes; analysis seeds the M4c graph.
- **RG3 Grounded rich plan.** The plan-agent produces the plan-graph (masterplan → subplans, each
  with requirements, deps, rationale, explicit uncertainty), grounded in the graph + coverage
  report — aimed at "needs only slight adjustment."
- **RG4 Chat approach.** Human↔agent interaction is conversational (agent may ask; human answers in
  free text), durable across crashes, from the first consent question.
- **RG5 Human-shaped, versioned plan.** The human annotates plan-notes (referencing other notes) as
  events; each re-plan produces a new plan **version**; plan files are projections never hand-edited.
- **RG6 Approve = start.** Approval instantiates a frozen M5a plan from the approved plan-note graph
  and hands *that* to execution (the instantiation is the freeze — no live-note re-reads); post-approve
  edits require an explicit reopen.
- **RG7 Graceful degradation.** No codebase access ⇒ an empty `CoverageReport`; the plan is authored
  from assumptions with **every gap a marked uncertainty**; execution can pause for feedback there.
- **RG8 Analyzer extensibility.** The lazy analyzer sits behind a seam a structural AST indexer joins
  later with no rewrite of the lazy path or the plan-agent's query surface.
- **RG9 Per-role rigor.** Each role gets a memory posture (analyzer = scout; plan-agent = auditor).
- **RG10 Plan as a bounded note-graph.** The plan is a **task-scoped graph of linked plan-notes**
  (masterplan → subplans), each bounded and navigable, so it scales without becoming unreadable, is
  edited/re-planned per note, and is consumed by implementing agents through graph traversal.

## 3. Decisions

- **D1 — Two graph *kinds*, one seam (the anti-flood rule).** cbm's note is explicit: its graph is
  machine-derived code *structure*; ours is *authored knowledge*; **merging floods memory with
  machine facts**. So analysis does not dump symbols into M4c — the lazy analyzer authors
  *interpretive, bounded, task-relevant* notes; a future structural graph is a **separate projection
  service** (peer of `openStorage`/`openKnowledge`) behind the same seam.
- **D2 — `Analyzer` is a registered plugin type**, like `ModelProvider`/`AgentExecutor`
  (EXTENDING.md row + `refValidator` check). `analyze(input) → CoverageReport`, optionally declaring
  query tools; `analyzerRef` on the strategy selects it. The lazy `agent-analyzer` adds **zero new
  runtime** — an ordinary orchestrated agent step with a skill (the README documentation-task
  pattern). One-impl-now is requested and justified: a concrete `ast-analyzer` is coming.
- **D3 — `CoverageReport` contract.** `{ analyzed: boolean, scope: string[], gaps: string[],
  confidence: 'high'|'medium'|'low'|'none', notesWritten: number }`. `analyzed` + `gaps` are
  load-bearing now (they drive RG7 degradation and RG3 uncertainties). `scope`/`confidence`/
  `notesWritten` are **deliberately reserved forward-looking fields** carrying cbm's coverage
  epistemics (research ideas #2 "absence ≠ proof" / #7 confidence-from-use) + telemetry the future
  analytics (hot-paths/churn) and `ast-analyzer` will consume — kept, not cut, because a struct field
  costs nothing now and prepares the vision. Empty/`analyzed:false` on no-access.
- **D4 — One conversational gate primitive.** Extend M5a's durable `join_splits`/`recv` gate into a
  **question/answer** gate: the executor yields a `gate` carrying a *question*; the port appends
  `feedback_requested`, `DBOS.recv`s per-question, resumes the turn with the human's free-text answer
  (`feedback_provided`) as the tool result. Same crash-replay story as M5a (no new persistence).
  **Reused by P0 consent, P3 annotation-driven re-plan, and mid-run feedback** — one primitive. The
  routing `topic` is **deterministically derived** (taskId + the gate's tool-call id, mirroring M5a's
  `split:<id>`) so `recv` replays deterministically; it stays an explicit field because the
  conversational gate juggles several concurrent question kinds (consent, per-note feedback, mid-run),
  unlike M5a's single split gate — kept, not folded away.
- **D5 — Annotations are events; the plan is a projection.** The human never edits a rendered plan
  file (vault files are projection-only and get overwritten). `plan_annotated { planVersion,
  targetNote, refs: string[], text }` is the input; the plan re-renders from events. The future UI
  emits the identical event.
- **D6 — Re-plan takes a `scope`.** `scope:'all'` re-proposes the whole plan-graph from (prior
  version + annotations); `scope: string[]` (plan-note ids) is the later targeted patch — naturally a
  `decomposes_into` subtree. **Full-scope shipped; subset is a value, not a rewrite** — the "easy
  edits on huge plans" seam.
- **D7 — Plan-note carries the planning content.** A plan-note holds `requirements` (its body),
  `rationale: string`, and `uncertainty: string[]`. Coarse structure is the `decomposes_into` graph;
  fine executable steps live on **leaf** plan-notes (their body → the M5a plan when instantiated).
  **Dependencies (`depends_on`) and substeps (`task_split`) already exist in M5a/M4c** — reused.
- **D8 — Per-role memory tier.** The strategy config names, per role, a `memoryTier:
  'scout'|'verify'|'auditor'` (default `verify`), keying the injected memory toolset + an epistemic
  prompt fragment. Builds on the scout/verify posture + "notes are data" + absence-epistemics M5a
  already shipped (ledger amendments A/B/E-i). cbm's three tiers, onto our roles.
- **D9 — On the M5a seam, port-driven.** The strategy attaches via M5a's reserved `strategyRef`; its
  phase hand-offs register routes on the existing SignalRouter route registry; the phase loop is the
  M5a two-way generator loop. No new orchestration substrate.
- **D10 — The plan is a bounded, task-scoped typed-link graph of plan-notes.** A plan-note is an
  **M4c `MemoryNote`** (`kind:'plan'`) scoped to the task (`scope: task-<id>` — the "temp graph in
  the db," a task-partitioned subgraph, still event-sourced/rebuildable/auditable, partitioned from
  project knowledge). Each plan-note is one bounded subplan/subtask; the **masterplan** is the root.
  Links: **`decomposes_into`** (parent → subplan; one new `LINK_KIND`) and existing `depends_on`
  (sibling ordering), optionally `derived_from` back to the analysis notes it was grounded in. This
  reuses the whole M4c stack — typed links, ranker, budget, render — so the plan needs **no new
  store**. Consequences: **(a) bounded** — each note is human-readable, the graph stays navigable;
  **(b) navigable** — links render as markdown links between plan files + a mermaid DAG; **(c)
  agentically consumable** — an implementing agent seeds at its task's plan-note and `memory_neighbors`
  to pull requirements + sub-notes, a bounded context slice (the M4c thesis, for planning);
  **(d) editable/re-plannable per note** — annotations (D5) target a plan-note, re-plan scope (D6) is
  a `decomposes_into` subtree, so huge plans never regenerate wholesale. **Execution correspondence:**
  at P4 the masterplan's `decomposes_into` children become M5a `task_split` children — the plan-graph
  is the blueprint, the task tree its instantiation; each subplan-note seeds its child task.
  **Scope safety:** the plan-note `scope` is a regex-safe derivation of the task id
  (`plan-<slug(taskId)>`, matching M4c's scope regex `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$`), so notes always write
  regardless of task-id shape. **Versioning & freeze:** a re-plan round bumps a `planVersion` on the
  task (an audit counter); individual plan-notes change via ordinary M4c note **revisions**. On
  approve the port **instantiates a frozen M5a `ChildPlanDraft` tree from the approved plan-note
  graph** (a one-time pure translation, reusing `proposeSplit`); execution runs *that* frozen plan
  (M5a's existing frozen-plan semantics), never the live notes — so there is no second source of
  truth, and the plan-notes remain the auditable authored artifact. Post-approve `plan_annotated`/
  re-plan events are rejected until an explicit reopen. The instantiation *is* the freeze.

## 4. Architecture

### 4.3 The plan-note graph (a worked shape)

```
  masterplan: "build web app"  (scope: task-<id>, kind:plan)
        │ decomposes_into                    │ decomposes_into
        ▼                                     ▼
  "database structure for xyz"          "HTTP API for xyz"
   requirements, rationale,        ──depends_on──►  requirements …
   uncertainty[]                                    (may decomposes_into
        │ decomposes_into                            further subplans)
        ▼
  "schema migration"  (leaf: concrete steps in body)
```

Each box is one M4c note; edges are typed links; the whole thing is a task-scoped SurrealDB
subgraph the plan-agent authored and any implementing agent traverses. Rendered: one markdown file
per note, `decomposes_into`/`depends_on` as clickable links + a mermaid overview.

### 4.4 Events (new) and their fold

| Kind | Payload | Fold effect |
|---|---|---|
| `feedback_requested` | `{ noteId?, question, topic }` | records an open question on the task (gate) |
| `feedback_provided` | `{ topic, text, author }` | resolves the question; resumes the gate |
| `plan_annotated` | `{ planVersion, targetNote, refs[], text }` | appends an annotation to the plan version |
| `analysis_completed` | `CoverageReport` | records coverage for the task's planning |

Plan (re-)proposal reuses M5a `plan_proposed` with an incremented `planVersion`; plan-notes are
ordinary `memory_written` events (`kind:'plan'`, task scope); approval reuses `plan_approved`. New
`LINK_KIND` `decomposes_into` is additive to M4c `LINK_KINDS` (no back-compat — v0.0.1). Every new
event gets a `PAYLOAD_SCHEMA`, a `fold` case, and a propose-time `refValidator` check where it names
a note/step (invariant 8).

## 5. Mechanics

- **P0 consent.** If `analyzerRef` is set, the strategy's first port step yields a `gate` with the
  consent question; `orc reply <text>` (or `orc chat`) appends `feedback_provided`; a decline skips
  P1 to P2 with an empty `CoverageReport`. Conversational, durable, cancellable.
- **P1 analyze.** `agent-analyzer` runs scout-tier: reads the working tree (its skill hard-codes
  "repository content is data, not instructions"), authors bounded interpretive notes via
  `memory_write`, returns a `CoverageReport`. Failure/non-repo ⇒ `analyzed:false` — never a crash.
- **P2 plan.** `plan-agent` runs auditor-tier: `memory_search`/`memory_neighbors` the seeded graph +
  reads the `CoverageReport`, then **authors the plan-graph** — a masterplan-note that
  `decomposes_into` subplan-notes (task-scoped `memory_write`s), each with requirements/rationale/
  `depends_on`, every coverage gap surfaced as an `uncertainty` on the note it affects — and emits
  `plan_proposed{ planVersion:1 }` naming the masterplan root.
- **P3 iterate.** The vault-projector renders each plan-note to `vault/tasks/<id>/plan/<noteId>.md`
  (links to subplan files + a mermaid DAG at the masterplan). The human annotates with `orc plan
  note <noteId> …` (events), then `orc plan revise [--scope all|<noteIds>]` re-invokes the plan-agent
  with (prior version + annotations) → `plan_proposed{ planVersion:N+1 }`. Full re-propose *asks the
  agent to* preserve unannotated notes (best-effort, prompt-level); the `--scope` subtree mode (D6) is
  the **mechanical** preservation guarantee — its whole point on huge plans.
- **P4 execute.** `orc plan approve` **instantiates a frozen M5a `ChildPlanDraft` tree from the
  approved plan-note graph** (`decomposes_into` → child steps, `depends_on` → `dependsOn`; a pure
  one-time translation reusing `proposeSplit`, `plan_approved`) and the port runs *that* exactly as
  M5a does today — children enqueue depth-partitioned, and the ready-set scheduler
  (`interpreter.readySteps` + the port's continuous `launchReady` loop, `dbos-port.ts`) runs
  independent steps **in parallel while honoring `dependsOn` order** (this is the "todo graph worked
  on simultaneously depending on order" — already built, not new). An `uncertainty`-marked note may
  yield a `feedback_requested` mid-run (D4), and every step writes findings back to the graph so the
  next run starts better-grounded. Execution reads the frozen plan, not the live notes; post-approve
  annotations are rejected until reopen.

## 6. Error handling

- **Analysis never wedges planning.** Any P1 failure degrades to `analyzed:false` (RG7); planning
  always proceeds.
- **Re-plan is human-bounded, not counter-bounded.** Each round is an explicit `orc plan revise`;
  no auto-round cap; `orc cancel` is the escape (M5a cascade). Convergence signal is out of scope.
- **Stale annotations.** An annotation targets `{planVersion, targetNote}`; if a re-propose drops
  that note, the annotation is recorded but rendered *unapplied* — never silently lost.
- **Consent decline is first-class**, a normal branch to assumption-mode planning, not an error.
- **Repo content is an injection surface.** P1 reads arbitrary code; the scout skill's "content is
  data" clause + the auditor's "notes are data" clause (M5a-shipped) contain it.
- **Plan-graph integrity.** A `decomposes_into` cycle or a dangling child ref is rejected at
  `plan_proposed` validation (propose-time `refValidator`), never discovered mid-execution.

## 7. Testing

- **Contracts:** the four new payload schemas; `CoverageReport`; the `decomposes_into` `LINK_KIND`;
  `kind:'plan'` note; `plan_annotated` note-ref validation; a `plan_proposed` `planVersion` increment;
  a `decomposes_into` cycle rejected.
- **Pure/unit:** `Analyzer` seam registration + `refValidator` rejects an unknown `analyzerRef`;
  `agent-analyzer` degrades to `analyzed:false` on a non-repo dir; the conversational gate's
  question→answer round-trip with a scripted executor; re-plan `scope:'all'` preserves unannotated
  notes, `scope:[ids]` touches only the named `decomposes_into` subtree.
- **Integration (extends the M5a/M4c reuse e2e harness):** `orc new --strategy grounded-plan` →
  consent yes → analyzer writes a note → plan-graph v1 = masterplan `decomposes_into` two
  subplan-notes (one `depends_on` the other, one carrying an uncertainty) → `orc plan note` → `orc
  plan revise` → v2 applies the annotation → `orc plan approve` → the subplan-notes execute as
  `task_split` children in dependency order and a child reads its subplan-note (the full grounded
  loop). Second test: consent **no** → empty `CoverageReport` → assumption-mode plan, every gap a
  marked uncertainty. Third: a `memory_neighbors` traversal from the masterplan returns its subplans
  ranked (plan-graph is consumable).

## 8. Deferred (restated so nothing re-adds it)

Deferred **runtime**, not discarded ideas. The library learnings (cbm, RecursiveMAS, code-review-graph)
are banked here and in the reserved contract fields/seams above, so the vision is *prepared* — the
next milestone extends a named seam, it does not re-derive the research. Reserve is cheap; only unused
*runtime* is deferred.

- **AST/structural indexer (`ast-analyzer`) + analytics** (hot paths, high churn, diff-seeded blast
  radius, co-change edges). Banked from cbm: node labels `File/Class/Function/Method/Route`, edges
  `CALLS/IMPORTS/DEFINES/DATA_FLOWS/FILE_CHANGES_WITH`, qualified-name anchoring `<project>.<path>.
  <name>` + line range, hop→risk bucketing, `get_graph_schema`-first orientation. A separate
  project-scoped projection service. Build none of it now.
- **The UI** (visual plan editor + start button). Events are the contract; UI is later rendering.
- **The general scoped-rules system** (global/project/task, skill-linked). Reuse M5a `ApprovalPolicy`
  + skills; build no rule engine.
- **Other topologies + slots/presets + general strategy registry.** `grounded-plan` is one strategy;
  the registry earns itself when a second exists.
- **Targeted-patch re-plan** (D6 `scope` subset), a **re-plan convergence signal**, gate timeouts,
  orphan auto-reaping — when a real need shows.
- **Vectors/RRF/BM25, push/auto-binding** — unchanged from the M4c deferred list.

## 9. Self-review

**RG coverage:** RG1 → §4.2/D9 ✓. RG2 → P0/P1, D4 ✓. RG3 → P2, D7 (requirements/rationale/
uncertainty), D3 (coverage) ✓. RG4 → D4 conversational gate, from P0 ✓. RG5 → D5 (events), D6
(scope), P3 (versioning) ✓. RG6 → P4 (freeze + M5a) ✓. RG7 → D3 empty coverage + P1/P2
assumption-mode + §6 ✓. RG8 → D1/D2 + §4.1 ✓. RG9 → D8 ✓. RG10 → D10 + §4.3 plan-note graph ✓.

**Minimality — minimal *runtime*, prepared *contracts* (deliberate).** New runtime is small: the
`Analyzer` seam, the conversational-gate delta, four events, one `LINK_KIND`, a two-field note delta;
everything else (analysis-as-agent-task, planning, execution, the parallel dependency scheduler,
queues, cancel, mermaid render, memory postures, typed-link graph) is shipped M5a/M4c/vault-projector.
But per the project's forward-looking standard we **reserve, not cut**, the cheap contract-level
scaffolding that prepares the vision: the `CoverageReport` epistemic/telemetry fields (D3), the
`Analyzer` seam + banked cbm taxonomy (§8), the per-role tiers (D8), the re-plan `scope` (D6), the
deterministic feedback `topic` (D4), and the deferred topologies/registry seam (D9). Rule of thumb:
**reserve forward-looking data/seams (≈zero cost, from the library learnings); defer forward-looking
*runtime* (real cost, no consumer yet)** — so we build no unused machinery but keep the preparation
the vision needs.

**Ordering (for the plan):** contracts (events + `CoverageReport` + `decomposes_into` + `kind:'plan'`
+ note delta + `Analyzer` interface) → conversational gate primitive → `agent-analyzer` +
`codebase-analysis` skill → `grounded-plan` strategy phase orchestration → plan-graph authoring +
annotation events + `orc plan note`/`revise` + scoped re-plan → vault plan-graph render → per-role
memory tier → grounded-loop e2e. Pure/contract before consumers so failures localize.

**Ambiguity check:** "analyze the codebase" is bounded to *interpretive authored notes* (D1), never a
symbol dump. "Plan" is a *task-scoped graph of M4c plan-notes* (D10), never a monolithic file. "Chat"
is a durable question/answer gate (D4), not a streaming chat UI. "Easy edits" is the `scope`
parameter over `decomposes_into` subtrees (D6), not a live diff editor. "temp graph" is the
task-scoped partition of the persistent M4c graph, not an ephemeral non-durable store.

## Amendment A (2026-07-19) — strategy runtime realized as an analyze/plan template

Firming the implementation plan against `packages/kernel/src/execution/dbos-port.ts` +
`packages/kernel/src/kernel.ts` showed the port runs agent turns **only as plan steps**
(`runWorkflow` → `launchReady` → `stepWorkflow`, which looks the step up in `plan.steps`). So a
bespoke port "phase driver" — one reading of D9/§4.2 — would be new orchestration for no gain. The
lazier, faithful realization, with **no new port code beyond the D4 gate**:

- **grounded-plan is a two-step bootstrap template** on the task T: `plan = [analyze, plan]`,
  `strategyRef:'grounded-plan'`, auto-approved by policy, run by the existing scheduler. Seeding is a
  kernel helper (`createGroundedTask`) reusing `createTask` + `proposePlan` + `approvePlan`.
- **analyze step** (scout tier): the consent gate (D4), then the `Analyzer`-selected analysis. The
  `Analyzer` seam (D2) resolves `analyzerRef` → the analyze step's config (`analysisStep()`);
  `agent-analyzer` returns a `codebase-analysis`-skilled api-loop step; `ast-analyzer` later returns
  its own. `analyzed:false` degrades (RG7) with no crash.
- **plan step** (auditor tier) is a **conversation**: it authors the plan-notes (D10) — and *only* the
  notes (single source of truth) — then uses the D4 gate to present them and ask "changes or approve?".
  Each human reply revises **only the annotated notes + their `decomposes_into` subtree**
  (`plan_annotated` names the target note; the agent re-`memory_write`s just those as M4c revisions,
  leaving the rest byte-stable) — the **scoped/targeted re-plan (D6)**, so huge plans never regenerate
  wholesale and stay token-cheap. On "approve" the step calls a `finalize_plan` builtin that runs the
  **deterministic** `instantiateFrozenPlan(master, planNotes)` → `task_split` (auto-approved; the human
  already approved conversationally) → signals success. The frozen `task_split` children are the
  executable plan (S1 "instantiation is the freeze", execution runs the frozen children never live
  notes); deterministic translation ⇒ no notes↔plan drift.
- **The re-plan loop is the plan step's conversation** (D4), durable across crashes via `recv` — the
  "chat approach." It is **scoped by construction**: `orc plan note <note>` targets a note and the
  agent's targeted revision (above) is the *mechanical* easy-edits guarantee required for huge plans
  (D6) — **kept, not deferred** (it is a core end-goal capability). `orc plan revise [--scope <notes>]`
  is optional sugar over the same path. RG5/RG6/RG10 hold; the mechanism moved from a bespoke driver to
  a template + gate and gained deterministic instantiation.

Net new runtime: the D4 conversational gate, the `finalize_plan`/`instantiateFrozenPlan` deterministic
translation, and the targeted-revision discipline. Everything else is M5a template plans +
`task_split` + gate + M4c notes.
